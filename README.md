Cammy has found this really useful website which details the topics and objectives for the Kenyan Curriculum. We will now base the sections and content on the material on this website, which is in line with the document Zach sent originally. http://www.elimu.net/Secondary/Kenya/KCSE_Student/Maths/Form1/KCSE%20Form%201%20Maths%20Curriculum.htm

At the moment I am writing the Number section. I will be renumbering the folders to keep a logical order as I am missing the introductory section on Natural Numbers and the final order of things is not fully defined.
The Kenyan Curriculum Topics is the file I'm using to base the materials. Some of the topics in the list need to be sub-divided into several sections.
The aim is to keep each section as self contained as possible without referencing to each other for the time being.

Note to add: Real Life examples to introduce topics. 

Note to add: Factors of Natural Numbers section: When can we stop finding ways of multiply a number by two factors when finding all the factors and why. At least one example.

Note to add: a comprehension exercise from a 'real world' scenario


Rationale:

1. Self contained sections
1.1 Lesson objectives
2. Try to start with a motivation as to why we study the topic in question
3. Have a simple explanation of the topic in questions, using one or two examples within the explanations
4. Follow with clear examples on how the topic works
5. Exercises - quality and possibility to randomise rather than quantity (please talk to SB if unclear of what it means to randomise a question)
6. At least one exercise with real life applications

Note: Priorities would be point 1, 3, 4 and 5. 2 and 6 might need to be targeted to specific contexts so might need to be done separately. 


Main sections:
1. Number
2. Algebra
3. Geometry
4. Data
5. Calculus

Cammy's work:

Short Term Targets:
1. Understanding Git properly and being able to use it comfortably
2. Review the HFC and LCM sections to understand the Rationale
3. Start writing sections 9, 10 and 11 (Integers)
4. Meeting next Friday (6th June) to be confirmed.

Oliver's work:

1. Install git, clone the repository and learn basic git commands
2. Start Proofreading and add text files to comment on possible changes. Spelling, Grammar, Maths mistakes, Audience
3. Start looking at latex - Install it and consider "winedt"




NOTES FROM CHECKPOINT MEETING:
1. HCF Separate initial task as activity and solution to be deployed automatically or by the student.
2. Self contained doesn't mean that future learning can't be mentioned (decomposing numbers into product of primes, 'or' or 'other' discussion in BODMAS - think of mathematics as a language and how we communicate it). Perhaps in a different type of box. 
3.
