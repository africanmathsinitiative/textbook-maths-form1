At the moment I am writing the Number section. I will be renumbering the folders to keep a logical order as I am missing the introductory section on Natural Numbers.
The Kenyan Curriculum Topics is the file I'm using to base the materials. Some of the topics in the list need to be sub-divided into several sections.
The aim is to keep each section as self contained as possible without referencing to each other for the time being.
