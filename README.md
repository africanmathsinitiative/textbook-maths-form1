# textbook-maths-form1
At the moment I am writing the Number section. I will be renumbering the folders to keep a logical order as I am missing the introductory section on Natural Numbers and the final order of things is not fully defined.
The Kenyan Curriculum Topics is the file I'm using to base the materials. Some of the topics in the list need to be sub-divided into several sections.
The aim is to keep each section as self contained as possible without referencing to each other for the time being.

Note to add: Real Life examples to introduce topics. 

Note to add: Factors of Natural Numbers section: When can we stop finding ways of multiply a number by two factors when finding all the factors and why. At least one example.

Note to add: a comprehension exercise from a 'real world' scenario


Rationale:

1. Self contained sections
2. Try to start with a motivation as to why we study the topic in question
3. Have a simple explanation of the topic in questions, using one or two examples within the explanations
4. Follow with clear examples on how the topic works
5. Exercises - quality and possibility to randomise rather than quantity (please talk to SB if unclear of what it means to randomise a question)


Main sections:
1. Number
2. Algebra
3. Geometry
4. Data
5. Calculus

Cammy's work:


Short Term Targets:
1. Find more detailed materials on Form 1 curriculum. We only have a rough outline, we need more details.
2. Review the material already written and try to find ways to improve them or correct any mistakes. Try to think of real life uses of the sections without real life motivation.
3. Think of topics to start writing.
4. Touch base with SB to start writing - Friday 31st.
5. Start writing draft materials.
